Proteomics QC and Exploratory Analysis Examples

This folder contains selected R scripts demonstrating my approach to quality control and exploratory analysis of quantitative proteomics data. 
The examples are adapted from real research workflows but use anonymised or example data. The emphasis is on analytical robustness, interpretability, and appropriate methodological choice rather than biological claims.

These scripts illustrate assessments of data quality, structure, and signal before moving to formal statistical modelling or biological interpretation.

00_abundance_data_cleaning.R

Helper functions for tidying and standardising protein-level abundance data exported from proteomics software.

Helps ensure: 
	•	Consistent data wrangling and preprocessing
	•	Handling of peptide- and protein-level metadata
	•	Separation of metadata and quantitative matrices



01_qc_proteomics_example.R

Initial quality control and exploratory assessment of quantitative proteomics data.

Key analyses include:
	•	Per-sample missingness profiling
	•	Abundance distribution assessment of normal proteome abundance profile
	•	Inter-sample correlation structure
	•	Identification of potential outlier samples
	•	Generation of a combined QC summary figure

The accompanying figure (abd_myofib_qc_plots.pdf) summarises these checks and illustrates how multiple QC metrics are integrated to support downstream analysis decisions.



02_multivariate_exploration_example.R

Exploratory and supervised multivariate analysis applied after QC confirms acceptable data quality.

Analyses include:
	•	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to assess global structure
	•	Supervised PLS-DA with cross-validation
	•	Evaluation of classification performance and feature stability
	•	Conservative interpretation of separation (or lack thereof)

Supervised methods are used and interpreted in the context of cross-validation performance to avoid overfitting or overstating signal.
