Time-course Analysis of changes in proteome profile


This folder contains an example time-course analysis of longitudinal proteomics data, demonstrating how coordinated temporal expression patterns can be identified, interpreted, and validated using unsupervised multivariate methods.

The analysis is intentionally exploratory and discovery-focused, treating time as a biological variable rather than as a simple categorical contrast. 
The aim is to capture dominant temporal trajectories and contextualise them using functional enrichment and network-level analyses.

This work and scripts similar in  nature built the core frame work of this recent publication identifying differing time-courses of proteome responses to skeletal muscle loading:

Analytical approach

The workflow follows four key stages:
	1.	Statistical Analysis
  • Using a 2-way analysis of the variance to allow for full inclusion of the experimental design within the statistical model and subsequent biological interpretation
	2.	Trajectory identification
	•	Fuzzy clustering (Mfuzz) is used to identify dominant temporal expression patterns
	•	This approach allows partial cluster membership, reflecting biological uncertainty and shared dynamics
	•	Cluster number is chosen to capture major qualitative patterns efficiently rather than maximal separation
	3.	Functional interpretation
	•	High-membership proteins from each trajectory are subjected to functional enrichment analysis
	•	Enrichment results are used to contextualise temporal behaviour, not to infer direct causality
	4.	Network validation
	•	Protein–protein interaction networks are generated for clustered proteins
	•	Network connectivity is used as a validation step to assess biological coherence of trajectories

Main analysis script performs:
	•	Data structuring for time-course analysis
	•	Fuzzy clustering of temporal trajectories
	•	Extraction of high-membership cluster features
	•	Functional enrichment and network-level validation

Output figures

Example output figures included in this folder illustrate:
	•	Cluster trajectories
Representative temporal expression patterns identified by fuzzy clustering
	•	Functional enrichment lollipop plots
Enriched biological processes associated with each trajectory
	•	Protein–protein interaction networks
Network visualisation of trajectory-associated proteins

These figures are intended to demonstrate interpretability and downstream analysis methods rather than to present final biological conclusions.


This analysis is designed around several guiding principles:
	•	Temporal dynamics are best explored using trajectory-based approaches rather than repeated pairwise contrasts
	•	Functional and network analyses are supportive tools and should be interpreted conservatively
	•	Biological insight emerges from pattern consistency across methods, not from any single analysis step

Intended use

This example is provided to demonstrate:
	•	Analytical reasoning for longitudinal omics data
	•	Appropriate use of unsupervised methods in time-course studies
	•	Careful interpretation of enrichment and network analyses
	•	Reproducible, readable R-based workflows suitable for collaborative environments
