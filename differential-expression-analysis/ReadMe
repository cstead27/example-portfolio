Differential Analysis & Functional Interpretation Example

This folder contains a representative example of differential analysis applied to quantitative proteomics data, 
followed by pathway-level functional interpretation. 
The example illustrates how statistically tested changes are translated into biologically meaningful patterns using a transparent and reproducible workflow.

The scripts and outputs are adapted from real research pipelines but use anonymised or illustrative data. 
The focus is on analytical structure, robustness, and interpretation rather than on specific biological claims.

Primary analysis script demonstrating a standard downstream workflow following quality control and exploratory analysis.

Key steps illustrated:
	•	Differential testing between experimental conditions at the protein level
	•	Estimation of effect sizes and statistical significance
	•	Multiple-testing correction
	•	Parallel handling of protein abundance and protein synthesis rate outputs
	•	Preparation of results for downstream functional analysis

This script emphasises clear separation between statistical testing and biological interpretation.


outputs: 

Statistical result tables generated by the differential analysis.
	•	ABD_Ibu_vs_VC_stats_output.csv
Protein-level differential abundance statistics.
	•	ABD_Ibu_Upreg_GO_enrichment_results_list.csv
Gene Ontology enrichment results for up-regulated proteins.
	•	ABD_GO_enrichment_background_list.csv
Background protein set used for enrichment analysis.

These tables are included to show the typical structure and content of downstream outputs rather than to provide exhaustive results.
