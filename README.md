# Analysis Portfolio

This repository contains a small set of self-contained examples demonstrating my approach to data analysis, modelling, and reproducible reporting in R and Python, with a focus on omics and experimental biology.

The examples are intentionally compact and use synthetic or anonymised data. The emphasis is on **analysis structure, statistical reasoning, code clarity, and reproducibility**, rather than on novel biological findings.

## Contents

- **qc_pipeline**  
  Example quality control and normalisation workflow for LC–MS proteomics data, including distribution checks, transformation, and sample-level QC visualisation.

- **Analytical_pipeline**
  Simple, clean analytical pipeline comparing differences in proteome profile between different in Vitro treatment conditions

- **timecourse_statistical_and_clustering_analysis**  
  Time-course analysis using multifactoral ANOVA to extract significant interactions across time and conditions and apply unsupervised clustering and network analysis. 

Each folder contains its own README with context, assumptions, and instructions for running the example.

## Notes
- All data included are synthetic, simulated, or heavily processed for demonstration purposes.
- This repository is intended as a **portfolio of analytical patterns**, not a record of unpublished research.
- Code is written to prioritise clarity and transparency over maximal optimisation.
